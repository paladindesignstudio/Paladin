# paladin.github.io

This is a ready-to-publish portfolio website for **Paladin Design Studio**.

## What is included
- `index.html` — the one-page site
- `style.css` — styles for the site
- `assets/` — placeholder images and logo (replace with your high-res images)
- `README.md` — this file

## How to publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one): https://github.com
2. Create a new repository named `paladin.github.io` (exact name).
3. Upload all files and folders from this package to the repository root.
4. In the repository, go to **Settings → Pages** and set the source to `main` branch and `/ (root)`.
5. Save — the site will be published at `https://paladin.github.io` within a few minutes.

## Replace images and logo
Put your actual project photos inside `assets/` and replace these files:
- `assets/hero-architectural.jpg`
- `assets/petra.jpg`
- `assets/neoclassical.jpg`
- `assets/x10.jpg`
- `assets/hermes.jpg`
- `assets/logo-round.png`

## Contact form (Formspree)
Currently the contact form action points to a placeholder:
```
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/yourFormID" method="POST">
```
To receive form submissions to your email:
1. Sign up at https://formspree.io and create a form.
2. Replace `yourFormID` with the ID Formspree gives you.
3. Optionally add `_replyto` or redirect fields per Formspree docs.

## Custom domain
To use a custom domain (e.g. paladindesign.in), add the domain in GitHub Pages settings and update DNS records at your registrar (CNAME or A records). See GitHub Pages docs for details.

## Notes & recommended edits
- Replace placeholder images with high resolution renders (4K recommended for hero).
- Update social links & Instagram feed embed if desired.
- For analytics or SEO, add Google Analytics / Search Console verification meta tags.

If you want, I can commit these files to a GitHub repository for you (I cannot access your GitHub account). Copy the files into a repo named `paladin.github.io` and publish as described above.
